# Shared scripts, utilities and tools.

The main objective of this project is to share my work and knowledge, improve dev skills as the noob I am and become a little part of the community. 

As a windows systems admin, I started to save every piece of powershell code I've built. Most of them belong to simple needs or more logical than technical issues. 

Since Azure came, I realize that we can code everything, such as resources, deployments, configurations, monitoring, policies, roles, permissions and almost every simple code will be useful in more than one situation and then I've found a way to organize it and found in Github the right way to accomplish that.
