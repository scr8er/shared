The main objective of this project is to share my work and knowledge, improve dev skills as the noob I am and become a little part of the community.

As a windows systems admin, I started to save every piece of powershell code I've built. Most of them belong to simple needs or more logical than technical issues. 

Since Azure came, I realize that we can/have to code everything and I need a way to organize it and found Github.
