# Shared scripts, utilities and tools.

Welcome! I'm glad you are here.

The main objective of this project is to share my work and knowledge, improve dev skills as the noob I am and become a little part of the community. 

As a windows systems admin, I started to save every piece of powershell code I've built. Most of them belong to simple needs or sometimes more logical than technical issues.

Since Azure came to my world, I realize that we can code everything; resources, deployments, configurations, monitoring, policies, roles, permissions and almost every simple code will be useful in more than one situation and then I've found a way to organize it and found in Github the right way to accomplish that.

Finally, this is also a great way to publish a personal technical profile avoiding social networks.
